My major is the Computer Science. I have been studying my major for five years from the high school. 

Currently, I'm making a service that introduces 'killing-part' in famous songs. 'Killing-part' means that verse of songs loved by many people. I'm a server developer that maintains my service server.

When I was a high school student, I had seen my senior who made some computer programs. It looked like so interesting, I wanted to learn about that. Therefore, I came into club of engineering. I studied about computer language (like language of C). It was so funny to learn about activating computer programs. I fell love in my major :)

My major makes me keep studying. Because it changes very quickly, I will keep studying about upcoming techniques. But ironically, it makes me very exciting! And My favorite hobby is to study about the computer science. 

Nowadays, I'm taking a year off from my university. At earlier of this year, I got accepted '우아한테크코스' that instructs some techniques about the server development. I have studied in study program that is operated in '배달의민족' company from that time. If I do good jobs, it can employ me. So I have to study hard. 

I spend most of time with my teammates that develops my service together. When I didn't understand for some knowledge, they explained them very sincerely. Although studying sometimes made me feel bad, I can overcome if I'm with my friends together. I have deeply appreciated them.
