1. Tell me about yourself.
My name is Eunsol Kim, I'm taking leave of absence from Chung-Ang university, where I am a junior year major in Computer Science. I hope to use my skills to create a service that solves problems around the world. I am taking this leave of absence to develop those skills. 
Some of my personal characteristics that will help me with my goal and at any job are that I am good at cooperating with others and I am proactive at solving challenges when they arise. I try my best do the best work possible.
